ðŸŽ¯ What You're Missing (Recommendations)
Must Have:

âœ… Separated tests from linting/formatting
âœ… Security scanning (CodeQL, dependency scanning, secrets)
âœ… Lighthouse CI for performance
âœ… Accessibility testing
âœ… Docker image builds
Nice to Have (Future):

E2E tests with Playwright/Cypress
Visual regression testing
Bundle size tracking
Container vulnerability scanning (Trivy)
Dependabot auto-merge for minor updates
Setup Required:

Add Python security tools to backend:

quality-check.yml+3-3
Enable CodeQL in GitHub settings

Configure branch protection rules to require all checks

The CI/CD pipeline now follows best practices with:

Parallel execution for speed
Proper separation of concerns (quality, tests, builds, security)
Comprehensive coverage of code quality, security, and performance
Detailed documentation for maintenance
