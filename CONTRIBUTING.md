# Contributing to CO₂ Calculator

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide covers the essentials
to get you started quickly.

## Quick Start

New contributors follow this workflow:

1. Create or pick an issue describing your fix/feature
2. Branch from `dev`: `git checkout -b issue-123-feature-name`
3. Code with tests and documentation
4. Run `make ci` to validate locally
5. Push and create PR to `dev`
6. Address review feedback (1-2 days)
7. Merge → Auto-deploys to dev environment

**TL;DR:** `Issue → Branch → Code → Test → PR → Review → Merge`

## Development Setup

Install dependencies and start coding:

```bash
make install  # Install all dependencies
make ci       # Run all checks before pushing
```

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 24+, Python 3.12+, Docker, GNU Make

Run services for local development:

```bash
cd backend && make dev   # Backend on :8000
cd frontend && make dev  # Frontend on :9000
```

See detailed setup in backend and frontend README files.

## Commit Convention

Use conventional commits for automated changelog generation:

```
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve database connection timeout
docs: update API documentation
test: add integration tests for payments
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `style`, `chore`
