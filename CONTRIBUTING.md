# ðŸ“‘ Contributing Guidelines â€“ COâ‚‚ Calculator Development @ EPFL

## 1. Purpose

These guidelines aim to ensure the quality, security, maintainability, and longevity of the code produced for the COâ‚‚ Calculator project. They are based on the standards described in the EPFL project specifications.

---

## 2. Project Management

- The project follows the HERMES project management methodology (Swiss federal standard).
- Development must be planned and documented per phase (design, implementation, validation, deployment).
- All development work must be linked to a planned and approved task by the EPFL project manager.

---

## 3. Development Standards

### 3.1 Documentation

- Code must be documented with clear, concise comments that explain business logic and technical choices.
- Each module should include technical documentation (README, installation guide, API docs).

### 3.2 Style Compliance

- Follow SOLID principles and general programming best practices.
- Use a consistent naming convention (English preferred; use snake_case or camelCase according to the language).
- Keep a clear, coherent file structure that matches the project architecture.

### 3.3 Security

- Follow OWASP best practices (input validation, secure session management, etc.).
- Identified vulnerabilities must be fixed immediately.
- EPFL reserves the right to perform external security audits.

### 3.4 Performance

- Code should be optimized to avoid bottlenecks.
- Load and performance tests must be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

### 3.5 Testability

- Each feature must be covered by unit and integration tests.
- End-to-end functional tests must be provided for critical user flows.
- Test coverage is measured automatically and must remain above the threshold agreed with EPFL (to be defined).

---

## 4. Code Review

- All new contributions must be submitted via a pull request (PR).
- Each PR must be reviewed by at least one peer reviewer, plus an EPFL expert when required.
- Review criteria:

  * Code documentation
  * Adherence to standards and best practices
  * Security
  * Performance
  * Tests and coverage

---

## 5. Integration and Deployment

- The project must remain containerized and deployable via a public container registry (Docker/OCI).
- APIs must comply with REST/JSON standards and provide OpenAPI specifications.
- Code must remain the property of EPFL (internal license).

---

## 6. Maintenance and Evolution

- After each update: run non-regression tests systematically.
- Any evolution must be discussed and validated with EPFL before implementation.
- Track fixes and changes using a ticketing tool (to be defined).

---

## 7. Knowledge Transfer

- Each delivery must include documentation and guides needed to enable the internal team to operate autonomously.
- Training sessions should be organized to ensure the EPFL teams can take over the system.
