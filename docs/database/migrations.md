# Database Migrations

This document describes the database migration process, including tools, conventions, and best practices.

## Migration Tool

- **Tool**: Alembic
- **Integration**: Integrated with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Version Control**: Migrations stored in version control
- **Execution**: Command-line interface and programmatic API

## Migration Workflow

TODO: Document the migration process

### Development Process

1. Schema changes identified
2. Migration script generation
3. Migration script customization
4. Local testing
5. Code review and approval
6. Deployment to environments

### Migration Script Creation

- Automatic generation using `alembic revision --autogenerate`
- Manual script writing for complex changes
- Script template customization
- Naming convention enforcement

### Migration Testing

- Local database testing
- Test environment validation
- Downgrade testing
- Performance impact assessment

## Migration Conventions

TODO: Document migration standards

### Naming Convention

- Descriptive migration names
- Date prefix for ordering
- Action-oriented naming (e.g., `add_user_email_column`)
- Consistent formatting and style

### Script Structure

- Upgrade and downgrade functions
- Transaction handling
- Error handling and rollback
- Progress reporting and logging

### Data Migration

- Separate data and schema migrations
- Batch processing for large datasets
- Progress tracking for long-running migrations
- Validation and verification steps

## Migration Execution

TODO: Document migration deployment

### Environment Promotion

- Development environment
- Staging environment
- Production environment
- Rollback procedures

### Migration Commands

- `alembic upgrade head` - Apply all pending migrations
- `alembic downgrade` - Revert migrations
- `alembic current` - Show current revision
- `alembic history` - Show migration history

### Migration Status

- Pending migrations identification
- Applied migrations tracking
- Migration conflict resolution
- Migration dependency management

## Common Migration Patterns

TODO: Document typical migration scenarios

### Schema Changes

- Adding columns
- Removing columns
- Modifying column types
- Adding constraints
- Removing constraints
- Creating tables
- Dropping tables

### Data Transformations

- Populating new columns
- Converting data formats
- Merging or splitting data
- Data cleanup and normalization
- Reference data updates

### Performance Considerations

- Index creation and removal
- Partitioning changes
- Statistics updates
- Lock minimization

## Rollback Strategies

TODO: Document rollback procedures

### Safe Rollbacks

- Reversible schema changes
- Backup creation before migration
- Transactional migrations
- Point-in-time recovery

### Complex Rollbacks

- Data restoration procedures
- Manual intervention steps
- Service downtime requirements
- Communication plans

### Emergency Procedures

- Migration failure detection
- Immediate rollback triggers
- Service restoration steps
- Post-incident analysis

## Migration Monitoring

TODO: Document migration observability

### Progress Tracking

- Migration duration monitoring
- Step-by-step progress reporting
- Resource utilization tracking
- Error and warning logging

### Performance Impact

- Query performance before and after
- Lock contention monitoring
- Database load assessment
- User impact evaluation

### Alerting

- Migration failure notifications
- Performance degradation alerts
- Long-running migration warnings
- Rollback initiation alerts
