# Database Maintenance

This document describes the database maintenance procedures, including backups, monitoring, and routine tasks.

## Backup Strategy

TODO: Document backup procedures

### Backup Types

- Full database backups
- Incremental backups
- Transaction log backups
- Point-in-time recovery backups

### Backup Schedule

- Daily full backups
- Hourly incremental backups
- Continuous transaction log backups
- Weekly archive backups

### Backup Storage

- Local storage for recent backups
- Cloud storage for long-term retention
- Encrypted backup files
- Backup rotation and cleanup

### Backup Validation

- Regular restore testing
- Backup integrity verification
- Recovery time objective testing
- Recovery point objective validation

## Recovery Procedures

TODO: Document recovery processes

### Point-in-Time Recovery

- Recovery time specification
- Transaction log replay
- Consistency verification
- Application testing

### Disaster Recovery

- Complete system restoration
- Alternate site activation
- Data synchronization
- Service validation

### Partial Recovery

- Table or schema recovery
- Single database recovery
- Filegroup recovery
- Object-level recovery

## Monitoring and Alerting

TODO: Document monitoring setup

### Performance Monitoring

- Query performance tracking
- Index usage analysis
- Buffer pool efficiency
- Lock contention monitoring

### Resource Utilization

- CPU usage monitoring
- Memory consumption tracking
- Disk space management
- Network I/O monitoring

### Database Health

- Connection count monitoring
- Transaction throughput
- Error rate tracking
- Deadlock detection

### Alerting Policies

- Critical threshold alerts
- Warning threshold notifications
- Automated escalation
- Notification channels

## Routine Maintenance Tasks
