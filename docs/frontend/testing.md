# Frontend Testing

This document outlines the testing strategies, tools, and practices for the frontend application.

## Testing Strategy

TODO: Document the overall testing approach

### Test Types

- Unit tests for individual components and functions
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for user workflows
- Visual regression tests for UI consistency

### Test Pyramid

- Majority of tests: Unit tests
- Some integration tests
- Fewer end-to-end tests
- Selective visual regression tests

## Unit Testing

TODO: Document unit testing practices

### Component Testing

- Testing component rendering
- Event handling
- Prop validation
- Slot content rendering

### Composable Testing

- Reactive state testing
- Lifecycle hook testing
- Dependency mocking
- Async operation testing

### Store Testing

- State mutation testing
- Getter computation
- Action side effects
- Module isolation

### Utilities Testing

- Pure function testing
- Helper function validation
- Edge case coverage
- Error condition testing

## Integration Testing

TODO: Document integration testing practices

### Component Integration

- Parent-child component interactions
- Event propagation
- Shared state management
- Context provider/consumer relationships

### API Integration

- HTTP client mocking
- Response simulation
- Error scenario testing
- Authentication flow testing

## End-to-End Testing

TODO: Document end-to-end testing practices

### Test Framework

- Playwright for browser automation
- Test runner configuration
- Parallel test execution
- Cross-browser testing

### Test Scenarios

- User authentication flows
- Data entry and submission
- Navigation and routing
- Error handling and recovery

### Data Management

- Test data setup and teardown
- Database seeding strategies
- Mock service configuration
- Cleanup procedures

## Visual Regression Testing

TODO: Document visual testing practices (if applicable)

### Tooling

- Screenshot comparison tools
- Baseline image management
- Diff detection and reporting
- Threshold configuration

### Workflow

- Automated screenshot capture
- Manual review process
- Baseline update procedures
- False positive handling

## Test Reporting and Monitoring

TODO: Document test reporting

### Coverage Metrics

- Code coverage targets
- Branch and function coverage
- Gap analysis
- Improvement tracking

### Continuous Integration

- Test execution in CI pipeline
- Failure notification
- Performance benchmarking
- Trend analysis

For development setup, see [Development Guide](./dev-guide.md).
