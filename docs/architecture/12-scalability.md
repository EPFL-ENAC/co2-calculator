# Scalability & Statelessness Strategy

The system is designed for horizontal scaling with stateless components.

## Horizontal Scaling Plan

- Frontend: Multiple instances behind load balancer
- Backend: Multiple FastAPI workers
- Database: Read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Workers: Multiple consumer processes

## Stateless Design Principles Applied

All components are designed to be stateless:

- Session data stored in Redis
- User state persisted in database
- File uploads stored in object storage
- No local file system dependencies

## Load Distribution Mechanisms

- Load balancers for external traffic distribution
- Kubernetes service discovery for internal communication
- Database connection pooling for efficient resource usage

## Caching Strategy Overview

Caching is implemented at multiple levels:

- CDN for static assets
- Redis for session data and temporary storage
- Database query caching where appropriate
- HTTP caching headers for API responses
