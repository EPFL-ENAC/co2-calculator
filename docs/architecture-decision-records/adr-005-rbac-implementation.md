# ADR-005: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We needed to implement an authorization system that would:

- Provide fine-grained access control to system resources
- Integrate with our authentication system (Microsoft Entra ID)
- Support different user roles with varying permissions
- Be easily maintainable and auditable
- Scale with our growing user base and feature set
- Comply with security best practices

## Decision

We will implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) as our authorization model.

## Rationale

RBAC is well-suited for our requirements:

1. **Simplified Management**: Roles aggregate permissions, making it easier to manage access rights
2. **Scalability**: Efficiently handles growing numbers of users and resources
3. **Auditability**: Clear mapping between roles and permissions facilitates compliance
4. **Industry Standard**: Widely adopted approach with established best practices
5. **Integration Friendly**: Works well with Microsoft Entra ID and JWT tokens
6. **Flexibility**: Supports both role hierarchies and permission inheritance

Compared to alternatives:

- Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is too permissive and difficult to manage
- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) is more complex than needed for our current requirements
- Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is overly restrictive for our use case

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear separation of duties through role definitions
- Simplified user permission management
- Better compliance with security policies
- Reduced administrative overhead
- Consistent access control across the system

### Negative

- Initial setup effort to define roles and permissions
- Potential for role explosion if not carefully managed
- Need for regular role reviews and maintenance
- Possible over-provisioning if roles are too broad

## Implementation Details

Our RBAC implementation will include:

1. **Role Definitions**:

   - Predefined roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer, etc.)
   - Role hierarchy where appropriate
   - Clear documentation of role responsibilities

2. **Permission Model**:

   - Resource-based permissions (read, write, delete)
   - Action-based permissions (approve, reject, publish)
   - Context-aware permissions where needed

3. **Integration Points**:

   - Microsoft Entra ID groups mapped to application roles
   - JWT claims containing role information
   - Middleware for role-based access control in APIs

4. **Authorization Checks**:

   - Decorators/functions for protecting views and endpoints
   - Centralized policy evaluation
   - Audit logging for access attempts

5. **Management Interface**:
   - Admin interface for role assignment
   - Self-service role requests where appropriate
   - Approval workflows for sensitive roles
