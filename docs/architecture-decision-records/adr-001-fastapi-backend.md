# ADR-001: Use FastAPI for Backend Microservices

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We needed to select a Python web framework for our backend microservices that would provide:

- High performance for handling concurrent requests
- Built-in support for modern Python features (type hints, async/await)
- Automatic API documentation generation
- Easy validation of request/response data
- Good developer experience and productivity

## Decision

We will use FastAPI as our primary framework for backend microservices.

## Rationale

FastAPI offers several advantages that align with our project requirements:

1. **Performance**: Built on Starlette for ASGI compliance, FastAPI offers performance comparable to Node.js and Go
2. **Type Hints**: Native support for Python type hints enables automatic request validation and serialization
3. **Automatic Documentation**: Generates interactive API documentation (Swagger UI and ReDoc) from code annotations
4. **Pydantic Integration**: Built-in data validation and settings management using Pydantic models
5. **Async Support**: First-class support for asynchronous programming patterns
6. **Dependency Injection**: Built-in dependency injection system simplifies testing and modularity

Compared to alternatives like Django REST Framework or Flask:

- Django REST Framework is more opinionated and heavier for microservices
- Flask lacks built-in validation and automatic documentation features

## Consequences

### Positive

- Faster development with automatic API documentation
- Improved code quality through type hint enforcement
- Better performance than traditional Python web frameworks
- Enhanced developer experience with automatic validation

### Negative

- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with FastAPI
- Relatively newer framework with smaller community compared to Django/Flask
- Dependency on Python 3.7+ features
