# ADR-004: Use Celery for Background Job Processing

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We needed a solution for handling background tasks and asynchronous processing in our system that would:

- Support distributed task execution across multiple workers
- Integrate well with our Python-based backend
- Provide reliable task queuing and execution
- Offer monitoring and management capabilities
- Scale horizontally to handle varying workloads
- Handle task retries and failure scenarios gracefully

## Decision

We will use Celery with Redis as our distributed task queue system for background job processing.

## Rationale

Celery provides a robust solution for our background processing needs:

1. **Python Native**: First-class support for Python with excellent integration
2. **Multiple Broker Support**: Works with Redis, RabbitMQ, and other message brokers
3. **Distributed Execution**: Tasks can be executed across multiple worker nodes
4. **Flexible Routing**: Advanced routing capabilities for different task types
5. **Monitoring Tools**: Built-in monitoring and management tools (Flower)
6. **Retry Mechanisms**: Configurable retry policies with exponential backoff
7. **Large Community**: Extensive documentation and community support

Redis was chosen as the message broker because:

- Simple setup and operation
- Excellent performance for our expected workload
- Persistence options for task durability
- Pub/Sub capabilities for real-time features

Compared to alternatives:

- RQ is simpler but less feature-rich
- Custom solutions would require significant development effort
- Other queue systems (like RabbitMQ) are more complex to operate

## Consequences

### Positive

- Reliable distributed task processing
- Horizontal scalability for background jobs
- Built-in monitoring and management
- Flexible task scheduling options
- Graceful handling of failures and retries

### Negative

- Additional infrastructure component (Redis)
- Learning curve for team members
- Potential for increased complexity in debugging
- Need for proper monitoring and alerting

## Implementation Details

Our Celery implementation will include:

1. **Task Organization**:

   - Separate modules for different task types
   - Consistent naming conventions for tasks
   - Clear separation between task definitions and business logic

2. **Worker Configuration**:

   - Dedicated worker processes for different task priorities
   - Proper resource allocation and limits
   - Supervision and auto-restart mechanisms

3. **Monitoring**:

   - Flower for real-time monitoring
   - Custom metrics for task performance
   - Alerting for failed tasks and queue backlogs

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive logging for task execution
   - Configurable retry policies
   - Dead letter queue for repeatedly failing tasks
