Here‚Äôs a **concise summary for the lead developer** of what needs to be built and delivered according to the *‚ÄúCahier des Charges ‚Äì Calculateur CO2@EPFL‚Äù*:

---

### üéØ **Project Goal**

Develop an **open-source CO2 calculator** for EPFL research activities ‚Äî allowing each lab to measure, visualize, and simulate its CO2 emissions. The tool must be **scalable, secure, and reusable by other academic institutions**.

---

### üß± **Core Deliverables (Mandate de base)**

#### 1. **Custom Web Application**

* Responsive web app following **EPFL IT standards and branding**
* Multi-language (EN required, extensible to FR and others)
* Secure authentication via **MS Entra ID (OIDC/SAML2)**
* Modular, containerized architecture (deployable via Docker/registry)
* REST API (JSON, documented with OpenAPI/Swagger)

#### 2. **Main Functional Modules**

| Module                                 | Purpose                                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mon Laboratoire**                    | Annual data input for CO2 sources                                    |
| **D√©placements professionnels**        | Capture & calculate travel emissions                                 |
| **Infrastructure**                     | Buildings, energy use, equipment                                     |
| **Consommation √©lectrique √©quipement** | Energy from lab devices                                              |
| **Achats**                             | Purchases and material impacts                                       |
| **Services internes**                  | Shared platforms and internal services                               |
| **Visualisation des r√©sultats**        | Dashboards, PDF/CSV exports                                          |
| **Documentation & Contact**            | Help, support, resources                                             |
| **Interfaces de gestion (admin)**      | IT and business management dashboards, logs, user roles, data import |

#### 3. **Roles & Access**

* Gestionnaire IT
* Gestionnaire M√©tier (complet / restreint)
* Utilisateur¬∑rice principal¬∑e
* Utilisateur¬∑rice standard

Access rights and views depend on role and faculty (managed via Entra ID groups).

#### 4. **Data Integration**

* Manual CSV import validation
* Optional automated ingestion (e.g., lab energy data, staff database)
* Integration with **EPFL Accred** for user‚Äìunit linkage
* Externalized logging and retention (1‚Äì10 years)

#### 5. **Maintenance & Support**

* **Corrective & preventive maintenance**
* SLA-based intervention times (P1‚ÄìP3 priority levels)
* Annual high-load period in February (optional enhanced support)
* Regular security & dependency updates, regression tests

#### 6. **Training & Knowledge Transfer**

* Documentation + training for ~10 internal staff
* EPFL takes ownership of code and operation after handover

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Technical & Organizational Requirements**

* Must comply with **EPFL‚Äôs IT and security standards** (Annexe 8)
* Follow **HERMES project methodology** for project management
* Code reviews by EPFL (SOLID, OWASP, test coverage required)
* Deliver within **Q2 2026 (target production)**
* Open-source and portable to other institutions

---

### üß© **Optional Modules / Extensions**

* Infrastructure ‚Äì direct emissions
* Achats ‚Äì transport & other submodules
* Impact of external cloud services
* Simulation of research projects
* AI-assisted data integration (optional)
* Additional visualization and emission models

---

### üí∏ **Evaluation Weighting (for awareness)**

| Criterion           | Weight |
| ------------------- | ------ |
| Functional coverage | 40%    |
| Price               | 30%    |
| Organization        | 10%    |
| References          | 10%    |
